<p>There is as pleasant a little hostelrie in Lulworth Cove as is
to be found anywhere in a quiet sort of way, with lunch made
and provided, ready for all comers, be they never so plentiful.
Mind always on this coast command the lobster, he is <i>toujours
à vos ordres</i>. Those who can be content with the minimum of
variety in the way of amusement, and with the maximum of health
will assuredly find it here, where they can live the life of a sort
of luxurious <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>&mdash;bathing, fishing, walking&mdash;five or
six miles from the nearest railway station, and visited occasionally
by steamboats, which cannot come in quite close to shore, bringing
passengers, from whom tidings may be obtained of what is going on
in the outer world.</p>

<p><i>Note&mdash;Of music on board.</i>&mdash;Almost every steamboat is accompanied
by a couple of instrumentalists&mdash;a harpist and a violinist.
These duettists do uncommonly well pecuniarily, and musically too,
considering the difficulties presented by the sea passages. One of
their more favourite performances is the <i>intermezzo</i> from the
<i>Rusticana</i>. Returning from Swanage the wind rather interferes
with the strings by attempting to unfasten the music paper. But
the violinist, well on the alert, has foreseen the probability arising
of there being "three sheets to the wind," and has nailed his colours
to the mast, that is, has tied the music-paper firmly on to the stand.
Still, in order to grapple with rude Boreas, he has to drop a few bars
of his part in the <i>intermezzo</i>, a proceeding that causes no sort of
inconvenience to the harpist, who ingeniously "slows off," and
adapts time and tune to the exceptional situation, until the wind,
being out of breath with its mischievous exertions, allows the fiddle-strings
to resume their part in the concert, and kindly permits the
two musicians to finish triumphantly. Their gallant efforts are well
rewarded, and the musical pilgrims collect <i>largesse</i> in a scallop-shell.

<blockquote><p>
["There is a popular periodical which, whenever it can, manifests the
Liberal sentiments by which it has been guided from the first&mdash;I mean the
periodical <i>Punch</i>. At that time I had the honour of figuring, if I remember
right, in a Cartoon of <i>Punch</i>, in connection with the rejection of the Paper
Duty, and a clever Cartoon it was, for I was represented as a little lad in
school, sitting (it was <i>standing</i>, Sir&mdash;<i>Mr. P.</i>) upon a small stool, and Lord
<span class="sc">Derby</span>&mdash;the Lord <span class="sc">Derby</span> of that day, who led the House of Lords&mdash;was
standing over me with an immense sheet of paper, made into a fool's-cap,
which he planted on my head."&mdash;<i>Mr. Gladstone at Edinburgh, Sept. 27, 1893.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>The same great designer of "clever cartoons" ("our Sir <span class="sc">John</span>") is as lively as ever,</p>

<p>But a Crown of Honour be yours at the end&mdash;which we'd wish to postpone, Sir, for ever!</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your genial touch. We have pleasant joint memories, many,</p>

<h2>LIFE (AND DEATH) IN SOUTH AMERICA.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Diary of the week's doings, from our own Correspondent on the Spot.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Matters are still very unsettled, and it will take some
time before public confidence is entirely restored. The policy of the
President in defending the Tramways Extension Bill from the
citadel with grape-shot is condemned as an unwise stretch of the
provisions of the Constitution. It has caused a reorganisation in
the Cabinet, the Secretary for the Interior having resigned, taking
with him six regiments of cavalry, four battalions of infantry, and
three brigades of artillery. This desertion has naturally lessened
the chance of the Employers' Liability Amendment Bill passing this
session except at the point of the bayonet. The division on the
first reading of the Telegraph State Construction Bill was Ayes,
50 killed, 3 wounded; Noes, 12 killed, 172 wounded. Should this
measure pass its second reading it will be opposed from barricades
in committee.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Trade shows some signs of revival, but the continual
bombardment of the Stock Exchange by the opposition fleet in the
offing causes considerable confusion and annoyance. The Minister
of War has retired into a parliamentary cave accompanied by the
militia. It is considered not improbable that this member of the
ministry may throw his ammunition into the scale against his
colleagues. The Pauper Property Insurance Bill has not much
chance of passing during the present year, unless its supporters can
bombard the capital. The second reading of the Lunacy Acts
Consolidation Bill was passed with the assistance of three ironclads
and a torpedo catcher. In spite of the pacific turn that events are now
taking, some of the older inhabitants express considerable uneasiness.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;The British Consul has given notice that he will
hold the ministry responsible for the damage done to his residence.
On account of the bombardment he and his family have been forced
to reside in a distant greenhouse. The remainder of the consulate
is razed to the ground. This being the President's birthday, the
hall of the <i>bureau</i> has been crowded with infernal machines sent
as presents. The loud ticking of the concealed machinery has
caused several complaints to be made to the <i>concierge</i>. The President
and his family have returned to the seaside. They are being
hotly pursued by a large body of cavalry, infantry, and artillery.
However, on the whole the outlook is brighter, and the trains and
omnibuses have recommenced running.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;The President has returned to the capital, as the
lodgings he had taken at the seaside were discovered by the rebel
fleet, and bombarded. The business of the session progresses
slowly but surely. The Minister for War, with the assistance of
the Militia, has secured the passing of the vote dealing with his
department. He led the charge in person that carried the "Ayes"
Division Lobby. If it were not for the constant bombardment of
all the principal buildings, and the occasional slaughter of Members
of Parliament, things would be almost normal. There is no doubt
that the outlook is peaceful.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>

<p><i>Friday.</i>.&mdash;Things still quieting down.
Traffic in the main thoroughfares is suspended,
because the roads are required for
charges of cavalry, and the squares are
now used for shell practice. The fleet have
approached closer. This, of course, causes
some additional damage; but as the populace
can now hear the bands of the various ships
during the pauses in the bombardment, the
arrangement is rather popular than otherwise.
The Government have apologised to
the British Consul for having blown up his
house and stables. The incident consequently
is at an end. Several Members of the Cabinet
have accepted the Consul's invitation to
lunch.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>.&mdash;The Revolution is practically
at an end. The fleet are still bombarding
the forts, and the military charge every ten
minutes the populace. The Judges, too, find
cause for annoyance in the constant invasion
of the judicial bench by armed artisans.
Most of the fashionable part of the city is in
flames, but this is a detail. However, taking
all things into consideration, peace and
tranquillity may be said to be now restored.
Of course they are not exactly the peace and
tranquillity of Europe, but they are what
people are accustomed to over here. Should
anything of further importance transpire it
shall be wired immediately; but to all
appearance the insurrection is at an end.</p>

<h3>(<i>A Story in Scenes.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="sc">Scene VI.</span>&mdash;<i>The Breakfast-room at Hornbeam Lodge.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Time&mdash;8.40 A.M.</span> <i>on Saturday morning</i>. Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>is
alone</i>, <i>making the tea</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey</i> (<i>to herself</i>). I cannot think what has come to
<span class="sc">Theophilus</span>. He has come down late for prayers every morning
this week. Such a bad example for any household, and Cook is
beginning to notice it&mdash;I could see it in her eye as she came in.
He is so strange in his manner, too; if I did not know he was
absolutely incapable of&mdash;but <i>why</i> did he secrete that abominable
programme of <span class="sc">Charles's</span>? He <i>said</i> he kept it with a view to
making inquiries, but I have heard nothing about them since.
(<i>Aloud</i>, <i>to</i> <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>, <i>who brings in dishes and two
letters</i>.) Oh, the
post, <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>? it's late this morning. (<span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span> <i>goes
out</i>.) One for
Pa, and one for me&mdash;from <span class="sc">Althea</span>&mdash;it was certainly time she wrote.
(<i>Reading her letter.</i>) "Delightful visit ... the <span class="sc">Merridews</span> so
kind ... so much to see and do ... back on Monday ... no
time for more at present." Not a word of where she's been or what
she's seen&mdash;not at <i>all</i> the letter a girl should write to her mother!
I wonder whom Pa's letter is from? (<i>She turns it over.</i>) What's
this? "Eldorado Palace of Varieties"
printed on the flap! Why,
that's <span class="sc">Charles's</span> music-hall! Then
Pa <i>has</i> been making inquiries after
all. As <span class="sc">Charles's</span> aunt I have a
right to&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She is about to open
the envelope.</i>) No, I'd better not,
I hear Pa's hum&mdash;he will be sure
to tell me what they say.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey enters</i> (<i>humming, to
give himself a countenance</i>). Ha,
so you've had prayers without me?
Quite right&mdash;quite right.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>severely</i>). Anything
<i>but</i> right, Pa. You ought to have
been down long ago. I heard you
brushing your hair as I went out.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>feebly</i>). It was very
tiresome, my love, but my collar-stud
got under the wardrobe, and I
couldn't get it out for ever so long.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Your things have
taken to behave in a very extraordinary
manner, Pa. Yesterday
it was your braces!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I&mdash;I believe it <i>was</i>
my braces yesterday. Ah well, we
must bear with these little vexations&mdash;bear
with them! (<i>To himself.</i>)
A letter for me? From the
Eldorado! It's the box! I&mdash;I
hoped Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> had forgotten.</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He thrusts it into his pocket unopened,
in a flurry.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Is there any reason
why you shouldn't read your letter,
Pa? It may be of importance.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I&mdash;I don't think it is, my love&mdash;particularly. It&mdash;it
will keep till after breakfast. What is this&mdash;kedgeree? Ha! I've
come down with quite an appetite&mdash;quite a famous appetite!</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>He pecks at his kedgeree ostentatiously.</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Perhaps I'd better ring and have two more eggs
boiled if you're so hungry as all that, Pa?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>in terror at this suggestion</i>). Not for me, my love, not
for me. I&mdash;I've made an excellent breakfast!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Then now, Pa, perhaps you will be at leisure to read
your letter. I am curious to know what correspondence you can
possibly have with an Eldorado Palace.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Oh, dear me, she's seen the flap! Why
do they put the name outside&mdash;so thoughtless of them! (<i>He opens
the letter.</i>) Yes, it <i>is</i> the order. I <i>can't</i> show it to
<span class="sc">Cornelia</span>!
(<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I told you I was making inquiries.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> About <span class="sc">Charles's</span> habits? So you've written to the
Manager, without consulting me! Well&mdash;what does he say?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). I don't like these deceptions&mdash;but I
<i>must</i>
consider poor <span class="sc">Charles</span>. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh&mdash;hum&mdash;very little, my love,
very little indeed, but satisfactory&mdash;most satisfactory&mdash;he's no
complaint to make of <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;none whatever!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> As if it was likely you would get the truth from such
a tainted source! Let me see his letter.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>pocketing the letter again, hastily</i>). No, my dear love,
you must excuse me&mdash;but this is a private and confidential communication,
and&mdash;and, in common fairness to <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;I'll trouble
you for another cup of tea. (<i>To himself.</i>) It's for this very night.
I've a great mind not to go. How am I to make an excuse for
getting away? (<i>Aloud.</i>) I've half a mind to run up some time,
and&mdash;and look in on <span class="sc">Charles</span>.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). If <span class="sc">Charles</span> is misconducting
himself, I
ought to know&mdash;and I <i>will</i>, sooner or later. I'm sure <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>
is keeping something from me. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I've only put in one
lump, Pa. You may find him at home if you went up this
afternoon.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>relieved</i>). An excellent suggestion, my love. I
<i>will</i>
go this afternoon. He&mdash;he might ask me to stay and dine with
him; so if&mdash;if I don't come back, you'll know where I am&mdash;eh?
You won't be anxious?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). He's trying to spare me, but I can see
he's <i>most</i> uneasy about <span class="sc">Charles</span>. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, Pa, I
don't like
the idea of your dining out without me&mdash;it will be the first time for
years&mdash;but still, I shall have to be away myself this evening;
there's a special meeting of the Zenana Mission Committee, and
Mrs. <span class="sc">Cumberbatch</span> made such a point of my attending&mdash;so, if you
feel you really <i>ought</i> to see <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Oh. I <i>do</i>, my dear. He&mdash;he wants looking after. And
perhaps, if I could have a little quiet, serious talk with him, after
dinner&mdash;or over a game of draughts. (<i>To himself.</i>) What a
dissembler I've become; but I <i>do</i>
mean to look in on <span class="sc">Charles</span>, before
I go to this Eldorado place, and
there <i>may</i> be time for a game of
draughts!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> You would learn
more, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>, by putting a
few questions to his landlady. But
remember, when you come back,
I shall insist on being told everything&mdash;<i>everything</i>,
mind!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Oh, of course, my
love, of course. (<i>To himself.</i>) If
my visit proves satisfactory, I&mdash;I
might tell her. It will depend on
how I feel&mdash;entirely on how I feel.</p>

<p class="center">END OF SCENE VI.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">SCENE VII.&mdash;<i>The Drawing-room.</i>
<i>It is after luncheon.</i> Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>
<i>is sitting knitting</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey</i> (<i>entering, in a frock-coat,
carrying a tall hat</i>). Er&mdash;<span class="sc">Cornelia</span>,
my love, you don't happen
to know where the&mdash;the latchkey
is kept, do you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey.</i> The latchkey,
<span class="sc">Theophilus</span>! One has never been
required in this house <i>yet</i>. What can
you possibly want with a latchkey?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). These
performances go on till a somewhat
advanced hour, I've no doubt,
and I might feel it my duty to
stay as long as&mdash;&mdash; (<i>Aloud.</i>) I&mdash;I
only thought it would save <span class="sc">Ph&oelig;be</span>
sitting up for me, my dear.</p>

<p>"Eldorado Palace of Varieties. Admit Mr. Toovey and Party to
Box C. This portion to be retained."</p></div>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> You need not trouble yourself about that, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>.
I will sit up for you, if necessary.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>quaking</i>). But you forget your Zenana Mission, my
love; you will be out yourself this evening!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>severely</i>). I shall be back by a reasonable hour,
Pa,&mdash;and
so will <i>you</i>, I should hope.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I hope so, my love, I'm sure, but&mdash;but I may have a
good deal to say to <span class="sc">Charles</span>, you know.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>to herself</i>). There's some mystery about that wretched
boy, I'm certain. If I could only find out what was in that letter.
I wonder if it's in Pa's pocket&mdash;I'll soon see. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Turn round,
Pa. Ah, I <i>thought</i> as much; one of your coat-tail buttons is as
nearly off as it can be!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>innocently</i>). Dear me! My Sunday coat, too. I never
observed it. Could you just fasten it on a little more securely?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> If you take off your coat. I can't do it with you
prancing about in front of me, Pa. (<i>Mr. T. takes off his coat.</i>)
Now, I can't have you in my drawing-room in your shirtsleeves&mdash;suppose
somebody called! Go into your study and wait there till
I've done. (<i>Mr. T. departs submissively.</i>) Now if the letter isn't
in one of these pockets, it must be in&mdash;&mdash; (<i>She discovers the envelope.</i>)
There it is. <i>Now</i> I shall know what <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;&mdash; I'm sure his poor
dear mother would wish to be informed. (<i>She opens the letter.</i>)
"Eldorado Palace of Varieties. Admit Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> and party to
Box C. This portion to be retained." (<i>She tears off a perforated
slip.</i>) I <i>will</i> retain it! So <span class="sc">Theophilus</span> has been deceiving
me&mdash;<i>this</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
is his business with <span class="sc">Charles</span>! <i>This</i> is why he kept that
programme!
And he's allowing himself to be misled by his own
nephew! They're going to this music-hall to-night, together!
He shall <i>not</i> go&mdash;never while I&mdash;stop, let me think&mdash;yes, he <i>shall</i>
go&mdash;he
shall fill up the measure of his iniquity, little dreaming that I
have the clear proof of his deceit! (<i>She thrusts the slip she has
torn off into her workbox, and replaces the envelope with the
remainder of the order in the pocket.</i>) There. He won't notice
that anything is missing. He's coming back. I must control
myself, or he will be on his guard.</p>

<p class="ind2">[<i>She pretends to secure the button with unsteady fingers.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>entering</i>). <span class="sc">Cornelia</span>, my love, don't trouble to
do
more than is absolutely necessary to keep the button secure&mdash;because
I'm rather in a hurry. It doesn't matter, so long as it looks
respectable!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>with an effort to restrain her feelings</i>). I daresay it
is quite respectable enough, Pa, for where you are going.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> Quite, indeed, my dear. But it would never have done
to go and call on <span class="sc">Charles</span> with a button off the back of my coat&mdash;no,
no. It was fortunate you noticed it in time, my love.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> I hope it will prove so, <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>. (<i>To
herself.</i>)
And this monster of duplicity is Pa! Oh, I wish I could tell him
what I thought of him, but not yet&mdash;we will have our reckoning
later!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> (<i>after putting on his coat</i>). Then I think I must be
going. Any message I can take to <span class="sc">Charles</span>?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> Yes, tell him that I trust he will profit by his good
Uncle's example, and that I expect him to dinner on Monday. I may
require to have a serious talk with him myself, if your account of
this evening is not perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toov.</i> I'll tell him, my love, but there's no reason to make
yourself uneasy about <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;he'll behave himself&mdash;he'll behave
himself. (<i>To himself, as he goes out.</i>) I must go and see <span class="sc">Charles</span>
now. Oh dear, I do feel so apprehensive about this visit to the
Eldorado.&mdash;If I could put it off.&mdash;But I can't continue to hold those
shares without some knowledge&mdash;&mdash; And Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> made such a
point of my going. No, I must go. I&mdash;I don't see how I can get out
of it!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toov.</i> (<i>alone</i>). There he goes, looking so meek and lamblike!
Who would suspect, to see him, that that black coat of his was buttoned
round a whited sepulchre? Oh, Pa, Pa! That after all these years
of blameless life you should suddenly be seized with a depraved desire
for unhallowed amusement like this! While I am at the <span class="sc">Cumberbatches</span>,
engaged in discussing the affairs of the Zenana Mission, you
and <span class="sc">Charles</span> will be&mdash;&mdash; Stop. How do I know he is going with
<span class="sc">Charles</span> at all? If he is capable of deceiving me in one respect, why
not in all? (<i>She takes out the slip and looks at it.</i>) Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>
and
party! <i>What</i> party? May not Pa have been leading a&mdash;a double life
all these years for anything I can tell? He is going to the Eldorado
to-night with <i>somebody</i>&mdash;that's clear. Who is it? I shall never be
easy till I know. And why should I not? There's the meeting,
though. I might have a headache. Yes, that will do. (<i>She goes to
her writing-table.</i>) No, I won't write. I can make some excuse to
<span class="sc">Eliza</span> when I see her. And instead of going to the
<span class="sc">Cumberbatches</span>
this evening, I can easily slip up to Waterloo and ask my
way to this place. There will be no difficulty in that. Yes, I will
go, whatever it costs me. And when Pa goes into this Box C of
his, he will find his "party" is larger than he expected!</p>

<h2>PLAYING THE DEUCE AT THE HAYMARKET.</h2>

<p>Of course, to speak with theological accuracy, <i>The Tempter</i>, being
the "very devil incarnate," ought to be "damned." That this has
not been his fate at the Haymarket is owing to Mr. <span class="sc">Beerbohm Tree</span>
primarily, to his company secondarily, and to the author remotely.
To treat in any fresh dramatic form the story of <i>Faust and Marguerite</i>,
a dramatist must be the subject of a special and peculiar
inspiration. Now what this play lacks is inspiration.</p>

<p>What in this piece <span class="sc">Enry Hauthor Jones</span> mistook for the "divine
afflatus" is mere long-windedness. His <i>Tempter</i> may be an entertainer
assuming various disguises, and more and more like himself
on every occasion, but a real devil he is not, except so far as Mr.
<span class="sc">Tree</span> with wonderful art makes him; and, even then, the question
is forced upon us, would any devil with any sort of self-respect,
pick up a cross-handled dagger just as if it were an ordinary walking-stick,
and politely return it to its owner? This is the first time that
a devil on the stage hasn't shuddered and grovelled at the sight of
a cross-handle. Again, how far more effective would some of the
supernatural movements of this irreclaimably wicked personage have
been had they been performed by means of some clever arrangement
of "wires," such as that with which Mlle. <span class="sc">Ænea</span> used to astonish
the public? Where are the stage mechanists who assisted <span class="sc">George
Conquest</span>, that unique representative of sprites and gnomes, who
achieved success by "leaps and bounds?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/161-600.png"><img src="images/161-300.png" width="300" height="356" alt="'Arbor in Arbore.' A Wood Engraving." /></a>
<p class="center">"Arbor in Arbore." A Wood Engraving.</p></div>

<p>Fortunately the piece does not depend for its success on mere
mechanism, but on the acting of Mr. <span class="sc">Tree</span>, which is in all respects
admirable in its diabolical variety; much depends, too, on Mrs. <span class="sc">Tree</span>,
who is charming and sympathetic in a small part. Mr. <span class="sc">Terry</span>, who
occasionally, in tone and look, reminds me of <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>, contributes
his share towards the general histrionic excellence, as also does
Miss <span class="sc">Julia Neilson</span>, who in tone and action frequently makes me
wish that once and for ever she would give up attempting an imitation
of <span class="sc">Ellen Terry</span>. But be it said that the acting of this couple
is remarkably good in the love scene, as it is also in the very trying
death scene, which could have been so easily and so utterly ruined.</p>

<p>The author is at his best in his curt, cynical sentences. Epigrams
are few and far between in the play, but what there are go to the
devil, that is, are given to the "Old Gentleman," with the best
possible result. <span class="sc">Enry Hauthor</span> is at his worst in the long
speeches, not one of which, no matter to whom it may fall, but would
be the better for cutting. Of course, suggestions for abbreviating the
<i>Tempter</i>'s part would not be favourably entertained by the principal
actor, as, naturally enough, any Tree objects to being cut down: and as
his personal success is too decided for him to be "cut up," the Tree
will have to remain, though lopping and pruning would be
advantageous to the growth and strength of this Tree now
that it has assumed these proportions. And the moral?
Well, <span class="sc">Goethe</span>, I think, in the poem was a trifle hazy
about the ultimate fate of his lovers; but in the opera
there is no doubt about it. With <i>Marguerite</i> it was
"Here we go up, up, up," and with <i>Faust</i> it was just
the reverse: but the operatic <i>Faust</i> will always "go down"
when sung and played as it was this season at Covent Garden. I forget
what <span class="sc">Boîto</span> does with his erring couple, but where Mr. <span class="sc">Jones's</span>
demon
resembles <span class="sc">Boîto's</span>, and also <span class="sc">Byron's</span>, Satan, is in his
monologues
addressed directly to the Supreme Being. But those Satans were
Fallen Archangels of Heaven; this of <span class="sc">'Enry Hauthor's</span> is a Fallen
Angel of Islington. This illogical demon sneers at one of the characters
for not using language sufficiently strong to express his feelings;
yet when his own turn comes his blasphemy is vulgar, and so
mild that not the sternest magistrate would like to fine him for it.
And strange to say, in one passage (which most persons would have
deemed objectionable, did it not come to them on the authority of the
Lord Chamberlain's Theatrical Licensing office), the Prince of Darkness
shows himself a gentleman curiously ignorant of such elementary
Christian theology as he could have picked up from a penny catechism.
How Mr. <span class="sc">Tree</span> was ever in-deuced to attempt the <i>Tempter</i> by
<span class="sc">Enry Hauthor</span>, will remain a mystery to the end of the run, and if
that should be in the far distant future, the mystery will be Tree-mendous,
and absolutely impenetrable. The costumes are artistic
and superb, the scenery effective, though the majestic proportions of
Canterbury Cathedral are rather dwarfed by the imposing figure of
the Very Deuce, who is "all over the place."</p>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>Question.</i> What are the functions of the
School Board?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> To protest against the conduct
of the Educational Department.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> In this protest has the Board the sympathy
of the public?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Unquestionably; because the conduct
of the Educational Department is calculated
to send up rates.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But does not the Department look
after the sanitary side of the matter?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Perhaps so; but sanitation is too
expensive a matter to be treated without the
maturest consideration.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Are the recommendations of the Department
unreasonable?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Very. The Board is required to make
the most costly alterations in buildings that
have already eaten up a large sum of money,
and should not consume a penny more.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But are not the suggested improvements
ones that would be accepted nowadays
in any new design?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Certainly, but then their adoption
would be the cause of little or no expense.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Then should science stop still until
the rates become abated?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That would be the practical course for
science to pursue.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But leaving grievances out of the question,
what can be said about education?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That is a matter of secondary importance,
when compared with the latest sanitary
developments.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But how about the children? Have they
been educated? What can be said about them?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Nothing. So far as the School Board
is concerned, the question of education in
general is absolutely of secondary importance.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Then the career of a child need not be
considered nor watched?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Of course not. The sole means suggested
for teaching a child is to squabble with
the Government and to more or less ignore
the requirements of the schoolmaster.</li>

<h2>THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Cunnin Toil.</i>)</h4>

<h3>No. V.&mdash;THE HUNGARIAN DIAMOND.</h3>

<p>Everybody must remember the apparently causeless panic that
seized the various European governments only a few years ago. It
was the dead season. Members of Parliament were all disporting
themselves on the various grouse-moors which are specially reserved
for that august legislative body in order that there may be no lack
of accuracy in the articles of those who imagine that the 12th of
August brings to every M.P. a yearning for the scent of heather and
the sound of breech-loading guns. Suddenly, and without any
warning, a great fear spread through Europe. Nobody seemed able
to state precisely how it began. There were, of course, some who
attributed it to an after-dinner speech made by the German
Emperor at the annual banquet of the Blue Bösewitzers, the famous
Cuirassier regiment of which the Grand Duke of <span class="sc">Schnupftuchstein</span>
is the honorary commanding officer. Others again saw in it the
influence of <span class="sc">M. Paul Deroulède</span>, while yet a third party attributed
it with an equal assumption of certainty to the fact that Austria had
recently forbidden the import of Servian pigs. They were all wrong.
The time has come when the truth must be known. The story I am
about to tell will show my extraordinary friend, <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>, on
an even higher pinnacle of unmatchable acumen than that which fame
has hitherto assigned to him. He may be vexed when he reads my
narrative of his triumphs, for he is as modest as he is inductive; but I
am determined that, at whatever cost, the story shall be made public.</p>

<p>It was on one of those delightful evenings for which our English
summer is famous, that HOLES and I were as usual sitting together
and conversing as to the best methods of inferring an Archbishop
from a hat-band and a Commander-in-Chief from a penny-whistle.
I had put forward several plans which appeared to me to be satisfactory,
but <span class="sc">Holes</span> had scouted them one after another with a cold
impassivity which had not failed to impress me, accustomed though
I was to the great man's exhibition of it.</p>

<p>"Here," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, eventually, "are the necessary steps. Hat-band,
band-master, master-mind, mind-your-eye, eye-ball, ball-bearing,
bear-leader, Leda and the Swan, swan-bill, bill-post, post-cart,
cart-road, roadway, Weybridge, bridge-arch, arch-bishop. The
inference of a Commander-in-Chief is even easier. You have only to
assume that a penny-whistle has been found lying on the Horse-Guards'
Parade by the Colonel of the Scots Guards, and carried by him
to the office of the Secretary of State for War. Thereupon you subdivide
the number of drummer-boys in a regiment of Goorkhas by
the capital value of a sergeant's retiring pension, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the rest of this marvellous piece of concise reasoning must
remain for ever a secret, for at this moment a bugle-call disturbed
the stillness of the summer night, and <span class="sc">Holes</span> immediately paused.</p>

<p>"What can that mean?" I asked, in some alarm, for Camberwell
(our meeting place) is an essentially unmilitary district, and I could
not account for this strange and awe-inspiring musical demonstration.</p>

<p>"Hush," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, with perfect composure; "it is the agreed
signal. Listen. The great Samovar diamond, the most brilliant
jewel in the turquoise crown of Hungary, has been lost. The
Emperor of <span class="sc">Austria</span> is in despair. Next week he is due at Pesth,
but he cannot appear before the fierce and haughty Magyars in a
crown deprived of the decoration that all Hungary looks upon as
symbolical of the national existence. A riot in Pesth at this moment
would shake the Austro-Hungarian empire to its foundations. With
it the Triple Alliance would crumble into dust, and the peace of
Europe would not be worth an hour's purchase. It is, therefore,
imperative that before the dawn of next Monday the diamond should
be restored to its wonted setting."</p>

<p>"My dear <span class="sc">Holes</span>," I said, "this is more terrible than I thought.
Have they appealed to you, as usual, after exhausting all the native
talent?"</p>

<p>"My dear <span class="sc">Potson</span>," replied my friend, "you ask too much. Let
it suffice that I have been consulted, and that the determination of
the question of peace or war lies in these hands." And with these
words the arch-detective spread before my eyes those long, sinewy,
and meditative fingers which had so often excited my admiration.</p>

<p>Our preparations for departure to Hungary were soon made. I
hardly know why I accompanied <span class="sc">Holes</span>. It seemed somehow to be
the usual thing that I should be present at all his feats. I thought
he looked for my company, and though his undemonstrative nature
would never have suffered him to betray any annoyance had I
remained absent, I judged it best not to disturb the even current of
his investigations by departing from established precedent. I
therefore departed from London&mdash;my only alternative. Just as we
were setting out, <span class="sc">Holes</span> stopped me with a warning gesture.</p>

<p>"Have you brought the clue with you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What clue?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he answered, rather testily, "any clue you like, so long as
it's a clue. A torn scrap of paper with writing on it, a foot-print in
the mud, a broken chair, a soiled overcoat&mdash;it really doesn't matter
what it is, but a clue of some kind we must have."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," I said, in soothing tones. "How stupid
of me to forget it. Will this do?" I continued, picking up a piece
of faded green ribbon which happened to be lying on the pavement.</p>

<p>"The very thing," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, pocketing it, and so we started.
Our first visit on arriving at Pesth was to the Emperor-King, who
was living <i>incognito</i> in a small back alley of the Hungarian capital.
We cheered the monarch's heart, and proceeded to call on the leader
of the Opposition in the Hungarian Diet. He was a stern man of
some fifty summers, dressed in the national costume. We found him
at supper. <span class="sc">Holes</span> was the first to speak. "Sir," he said, "resistance
is useless. Your schemes have been discovered. All that is
left for you is to throw yourself upon the mercy of your King."</p>

<p>The rage of the Magyar was fearful to witness. <span class="sc">Holes</span> continued,
inexorably:&mdash;"This piece of green ribbon matches the colour of your
Sunday tunic. Can you swear it has not been torn from the lining?
You cannot. I thought so. Know then that wrapped in this ribbon
was found the great Samovar diamond, and that you, you alone,
were concerned in the robbery."</p>

<p>At this moment the police broke into the room.</p>

<p>"Remove his Excellency," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, "and let him forthwith
expiate his crimes upon the scaffold."</p>

<p>"But," I ventured to interpose, "where is the diamond? Unless
you restore that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Potson</span>," whispered <span class="sc">Holes</span>, almost fiercely, "do not be a
fool."</p>

<p>As he said this, the door once again opened, and the Emperor-King
entered the room, bearing on his head the turquoise crown, in the
centre of which sparkled the great Samovar, "the moon of brilliancy,"
as the Hungarian poets love to call it. The Emperor approached the
marvellous detective. "Pardon me," he said, "for troubling you.
I have just found the missing stone under my pillow."</p>

<p>"Where," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, "I was about to tell your Majesty that
you would find it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said his Majesty, "for restoring to me a valued
possession and ridding me of a knave about whom I have long had
my suspicions." The conclusion of this speech was greeted with loud
"<i>Eljens</i>," the Hungarian national shout, in the midst of which we
took our leave. That is the true story of how the peace of Europe
was preserved by my wonderful friend.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
